###Important notes
Note that only .rpf files will get automatically recognised, since .prg and .src files are primarily associated with other languages. For .prg and .src files, please select the syntax manually. 

If you have suggestions or find any errors, such as missing key words, please contact me at dannec@tcd.ie.
